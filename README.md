## Plot
After a grueling fight for an apple with a prison guard, you wake up in
your cell and realize that you no longer have the strength to live like this anymore and you need to escape no matter what it costs. Fortunately, in this prison you will have such an opportunity. All you need to
do is break down the thick walls or kill all the guards. Talk to your
cellmates and guards, complete quests, explore locations and become the
first among equals!

## Technologies
* The system of __quests and dialogues__ allows you to create flexible storylines.
* GUI and rendering of game objects are implemented using standard __Qt tools__ for drawing in combination with __OpenGL__.
* All animation, texture of game objects and characters were developed at _MagicaVoxel_.
* Special native methods and logic were implemented to work with __isometric graphics__.
* The architecture of the application is based on the __MVC__ pattern (Model-View-Controller).
* The `resources.qrc` file was used for resource management, and `.json` files were used to store data and __serialize/deserialize__ game objects. Usage of `json-`s significantly increased the development speed and content (quests, dialogues, etc.) filling rate.
* –ê __flexible animation system__ allows you to use absolutely any state parameter to animate objects.
* __Bots and various types of interactions__ with them: _fighting, patrolling, pursuiting of the hero, route building, dialogues, looting things_.
